    <h3>Welcome to the fun facts page, here I have 3 fun facts about this movie for your viewing enjoyment.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Lucas struggled to get the film made.</h3>
    <p>In 1973, George Lucas directed American Graffiti, a coming of age drama set in 1950s Americana, and it was very successful. On a budget of just $777,000, American Graffiti made $140 million.<br>
        In terms of budget to gross ratio, it was more than twice as successful as Star Wars!<br>

Following this success, United Artists asked Lucas if he had any more ideas, and he told them about, “a space opera that’s a bit like a western, a bit like James Bond.”<br>

At this point, Lucas had a 14-page treatment called The Star Wars and UA passed on it. So did Universal. So did Disney. There was a division of Paramount called The Directors’ Company that was owned by Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin and Peter Bogdanovich. Coppola gave the treatment to Friedkin, and Friedkin says about it: “Francis brought us the script and I said ‘what the hell is this shit? Who’s going to direct this? Francis said, ‘George’ and I said, ‘I don’t think so.’ I didn’t believe George could pull it off, and I was wrong.”<br>

Lucas then pitched the idea to the Head of 20th Century Fox, Alan Ladd. On that pitch, Ladd says, “I had no idea what George was talking about, but I knew he was talented, so I invested in him” and he greenlit the film with an $8m budget.

<br>
<h3>The deal Lucas struck with the studio was pretty lucrative.</h3>
        <p>
            Lucas agreed to get paid $150,000 by Fox for writing and directing the film (not a huge amount at the time) on two conditions:<br>
            1.)Lucas would get full rights over any sequels to Star Wars.<br>
            2.)He got rights to all Star Wars merchandise. (Toys, books, video games, clothes, etc).<br>
            <br>
            Merchandise for movies was worth very little at the time so Fox agreed, and they were actually quite pleased with the deal. Since 1977, though, that deal has made Lucas $6bn, making him the richest filmmaker of all time.<br>
        </p>
<h3>Another legendary filmmaker was a big influence.</h3>
        <p>
            The opening shot to Star Wars, where a huge Star Destroyer attacks a rebel ship and rolls across the top of the frame, is one of the most iconic in history. Lucas actually took this idea of opening the film in the middle of an event in a strange world from Akira Kurosawa, the famous Japanese director (Seven Samurai, Rashomon, Run). Lucas said:
            <br>
            “Kurosawa would open up in the middle of 14th-century Japan, and not explain anything. He trusted his audience. I thought ‘not only does that work, but it works great!’ And that’s where it came from.”
            <br>
            Kurosawa also inspired the storytelling in Star Wars. In 1958, Kurosawa made a film called The Hidden Fortress. It’s a story about rescuing a princess, and is told from the point of view of two peasants who become embroiled in the narrative. Lucas changed peasants to droids, and decided to start the story in Star Wars from their perspective.
            <br>
            Not just that, but the famous transitional wipes that Star Wars uses to move between scenes was lifted straight from Kurosawa films as well.
